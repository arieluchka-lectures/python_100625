# Exercise 1: Split basics
# STRING.join()
# STRING.split()
###########################
sentence_1 = "Python makes string manipulation fun and powerful"

# Tasks:
# 1) Split the sentence into a list of words and store it in a variable named words_1.
# 2) Print the number of words.
# 3) Print the first word and the last word using indexing.
# 4) Create a hyphen-separated version of the sentence (e.g., "Python-makes-...") using .join().
# 5) Create a string of the last two words joined by a single space using slicing and .join().

# Exercise 2: Custom delimiters
###########################
tags = "python|strings|split-join|practice|beginner"
record = "john;doe;28;engineer;Seattle"

# Tasks:
# 1) Split tags by the '|' delimiter into a list named tag_list.
# 2) Print the third tag (index 2).
# 3) Join tag_list with ', ' to produce a readable string like "python, strings, ...".
# 4) Split record by ';' into a list named fields.

###########################
words_2 = ["Make", "it", "clean", "and", "readable"]
letters = ["s", "p", "l", "i", "t"]
digits = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]

# Tasks:
# 1) Join words_2 with a single space to form a sentence.
# 2) Join words_2 with '-' to create a slug (e.g., "Make-it-clean-and-readable").
# 3) Join letters to form a single word.
# 4) Join digits with ':' to create a time-like string (e.g., "1:2:3:4:5").
# 5) Join words_2 with '\n' to print each word on a new line in a single string.
