# --- Exercise 1: String to Number Operations ---
num_as_string = "50"

# Convert `num_as_string` to an integer.


# Multiply the integer by 4.


# Print the final result.


# --- Exercise 2: Building a Sentence ---
# You have different pieces of information. Combine them into a single sentence.

product = "Laptop"
quantity = 3
price = 1299.99

# Create the sentence: "We have 3 units of Laptop."
# You will need to convert the integer `quantity` to a string. Print the sentence.


# Now, create the sentence: "The price for a Laptop is 1299.99 dollars."
# You will need to convert the float `price` to a string. Print the sentence.


# --- Exercise 3: Calculations with Numbers from a List ---
# You have a list containing integers and floats. Perform calculations using its elements.

data = [15, 8.5, 10, 20.0]

# Add the first element (index 0) and the third element (index 2) of the list.
# Print the result.


# Multiply the second element (index 1) by the fourth element (index 3).
# Print the result.


# Subtract the first element from the fourth element. What is the data type of the result?
# Print the result.


# --- Exercise 4: Working with a List of String Numbers ---
# This list contains numbers, but they are all stored as strings.

str_numbers = ["100", "25.5", "8"]

# Access the first element, convert it to an integer.
# Access the third element, convert it to an integer.
# Divide the first number by the second one you just converted. Print the result.


# Access the second element, convert it to a float.
# Multiply this float by 2. Print the result.


# --- Exercise 5: Extracting and Converting ---
# You are given a string that contains a person's name and age.

person_data = "John-35"

# The name is before the hyphen and the age is after.
# Use string slicing to get the name "John". Store it in a variable.


# Use string slicing to get the age "35". Store it in a variable.


# Convert the age string into an integer.


# Add 10 to the age integer and print the new age in a sentence, for example: "In 10 years, John will be 45."
