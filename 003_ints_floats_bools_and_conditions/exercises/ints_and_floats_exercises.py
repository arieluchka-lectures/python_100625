# --- Part 1: Integers ---

# Create two integer variables, `a` and `b`, and assign them the values 20 and 5 respectively.
a = 20
b = 5

# Add `a` and `b` together and print the result.


# Subtract `b` from `a` and print the result.


# Multiply `a` and `b` and print the result.


# Divide `a` by `b` and print the result.


# --- Part 2: Floats ---

# Create two float variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them the values 15.5 and 2.5 respectively.
x = 15.5
y = 2.5

# Add `x` and `y` together and print the result.


# Subtract `y` from `x` and print the result.


# Multiply `x` and `y` and print the result.


# Divide `x` by `y` and print the result.


# --- Part 3: Mixed Types and Advanced Operations ---

# Use the variables `a` (integer) and `x` (float) from the previous parts.

# Add `a` and `x`. Print the result. Notice the type of the result.


# Create a new variable `c` and assign it the value 17.
# Use the floor division operator `//` to divide `c` by `b`. Print the result.


# Use the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of `c` divided by `b`. Print the result.


# Calculate `b` to the power of 3 (b^3). Print the result.


# --- Part 4: A Simple Calculation ---

# You are calculating the average of three test scores.
score1 = 85
score2 = 92
score3 = 78

# Calculate the sum of the three scores. Store it in a variable called `total_score`.


# Calculate the average of the scores by dividing the `total_score` by 3.
# Store the result in a variable called `average_score`. Print the `average_score`.


# Now, imagine one score was a float.
score4 = 88.5
# Recalculate the average of score1, score2, and score4.
# What is the data type of the new average? Print the new average.
