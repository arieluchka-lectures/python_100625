# --- Exercise 1 ---
# Loop through the `food_items` list. If you find "Broccoli", print "Found it!"
# and immediately stop the loop using the `break` statement.
food_items = ["Pizza", "Burger", "Salad", "Broccoli", "Ice Cream"]


# --- Exercise 2 ---
# Loop through the `mixed_numbers` list.
# If a number is negative, use the `continue` statement to skip to the next iteration.
# Print only the positive numbers.
mixed_numbers = [1, 5, -3, 8, -1, 10, 4]


# --- Exercise 3 ---
numbers_range = range(1, 21)
# Loop through numbers 1 to 20
# Skip (continue) numbers divisible by 3, print all others


# --- Exercise 4 ---
counter = 1
# Use a while loop to print numbers starting from 1
# Break the loop when the counter reaches 100


# --- Exercise 5 ---
sentence = "Hello World Python Programming"
# Loop through each character in the sentence
# Skip (continue) spaces, print all other characters


# --- Exercise 6 ---
text = "Programming"
# Use a loop to print the string in reverse
# איך ניגשים לכל אות בנפרד?


# --- Exercise 7 ---
scores = [45, 67, 23, 89, 56, 91, 34]
# Use a loop to find and print the maximum score


# --- Exercise 8 ---
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
# Loop through the numbers
# Skip (continue) odd numbers
# Print even numbers
# Break when you reach a number greater than 10

# --- Exercise 9 ---
# Count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the sentence below.
# The check should be case-insensitive.
# Print the final count.
sentence = "Programming is a valuable skill in the modern world."

# --- Exercise 10 ---
# Loop through the numbers from 1 to 30.
# If a number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz".
# If a number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz".
# If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
# Otherwise, print the number itself.

# --- Exercise 11 ---
# You have a list of student grades, where each inner list represents a student's grades in different subjects.
# Use a nested loop to calculate the average grade for each student.
# Print the average for each student, like "Student 1 average: 85.0"
student_grades = [
    [85, 90, 92],  # Student 1
    [78, 81, 80],  # Student 2
    [95, 97, 99]   # Student 3
]

# --- Exercise 12 ---
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
# Loop through the fruits
# Print each fruit name that contains the letter "a"
# Stop the loop when you encounter "kiwi"

# --- Exercise 13 ---
ages = [12, 17, 19, 24, 16, 20]
# Use a loop to separate ages into two lists: minors and adults
# An age below 18 goes to minors, otherwise to adults
# Print both lists at the end
