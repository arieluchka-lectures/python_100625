# --- Exercise 1 ---
# Loop through the `food_items` list. If you find "Broccoli", print "Found it!"
# and immediately stop the loop using the `break` statement.
food_items = ["Pizza", "Burger", "Salad", "Broccoli", "Ice Cream"]


# --- Exercise 2 ---
# Loop through the `mixed_numbers` list.
# If a number is negative, use the `continue` statement to skip to the next iteration.
# Print only the positive numbers.
mixed_numbers = [1, 5, -3, 8, -1, 10, 4]


# --- Exercise 3 ---
numbers_range = range(1, 21)
# Loop through numbers 1 to 20
# Skip (continue) numbers divisible by 3, print all others


# --- Exercise 4 ---
counter = 1
# Use a while loop to print numbers starting from 1
# Break the loop when the counter reaches 100


# --- Exercise 5 ---
sentence = "Hello World Python Programming"
# Loop through each character in the sentence
# Skip (continue) spaces, print all other characters


# --- Exercise 6 ---
text = "Programming"
# Use a loop to print the string in reverse
# איך ניגשים לכל אות בנפרד?


# --- Exercise 7 ---
scores = [45, 67, 23, 89, 56, 91, 34]
# Use a loop to find and print the maximum score


# --- Exercise 8 ---
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
# Loop through the numbers
# Skip (continue) odd numbers
# Print even numbers
# Break when you reach a number greater than 10
