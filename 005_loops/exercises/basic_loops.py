# For Loop Exercises
# ============================

# --- Exercise 1 ---
# Given the list of numbers, use a for loop to print each number.
# numbers = [1, 5, 8, 12, 15]


# --- Exercise 2 ---
# Given the string, use a for loop to print each character on a new line.
# my_string = "Python"


# --- Exercise 3 ---
# Given the list of words, use a for loop to print the length of each word.
# words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


# --- Exercise 4 ---
# Given the list of numbers, use a for loop to calculate and print their sum.
# You will need a variable to store the sum, initialized to 0.
data = [10.5, 20.0, 5.5]


# --- Exercise 6 ---
# Given the list of numbers, use a for loop and an if statement
# to print only the even numbers.
numbers_to_check = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


# --- Exercise 7 ---
# Given the list, use a for loop to count how many times the number 5 appears.
# Print the final count.
number_list = [1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, 5]


# --- Exercise 8 ---
# Given the list of numbers, create a new empty list.
# Use a for loop to go through the original list, multiply each number by 2,
# and append the result to the new list. Print the new list at the end.
original_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# ============================
# While Loop Exercises
# ============================


# --- Exercise 9 ---
# Use a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
# You will need a counter variable.
count = 1


# --- Exercise 10 ---
# Use a while loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
# Print the final sum.



# --- Exercise 11 ---
# Create a simple countdown from 10 to 1 using a while loop.
# Print each number, and then print "Blast off!" at the end.



# --- Exercise 12 ---
# Find the first number greater than 100 that is divisible by 17.
# Use a while loop to check numbers starting from 101.
# Print the number once you find it and stop the loop.


# --- Exercise 13 ---
# Write a while loop that runs as long as a variable `power` is less than 1000.
# In each iteration, double the value of `power` (starting from 2) and print it.
power = 2


# --- Exercise 14 ---
# Given the list of numbers, use a while loop to remove and print elements
# from the end of the list until it's empty. Use the `pop()` method.
items_to_process = [10, 20, 30, 40]
